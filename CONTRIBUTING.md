# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please follow these guidelines.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/urmzd/aap
cd aap
just build   # compile the Rust binary
just test    # run the smoke test
just bench   # run offline tokenizer benchmarks
```

```

## Making changes

- **Rust binary** (`src/`): file watcher, apply engine, telemetry. Keep dependencies light.
- **Telemetry** (`src/telemetry.rs`): structured logging via `tracing`, metrics summary on shutdown.
- **Evals** (`evals/`): LLM evaluation framework for measuring token efficiency. See `evals/README.md`.
- **New recipes**: add them to `justfile` with a comment describing what they do.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and ensure `just test` passes.
3. For Python changes, run `just bench` to confirm benchmarks still execute.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why.

## Code style

- Rust: `cargo fmt` before committing.
- Python: keep scripts self-contained and runnable via `uv run --project tools`.
