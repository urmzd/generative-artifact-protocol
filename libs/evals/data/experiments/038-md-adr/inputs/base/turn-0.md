Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR-003): "Use Event Sourcing for Order Processing".

Include:
- Title, Status (Accepted), Date, Deciders
- Context: current problems with CRUD-based order state, consistency issues, audit trail needs
- Decision: adopt event sourcing with event store, command handlers, read model projections
- Alternatives Considered: 2 other approaches with pros/cons
- Consequences: positive (audit trail, replay, temporal queries) and negative (complexity, learning curve, eventual consistency)
