> **Warning**: This project is `v0` — the protocol, schemas, and APIs are subject to breaking changes without notice until a formal release.

An open standard protocol — **[GAP](spec/gap.md)** — that lets LLMs declare, diff, and reprovision text artifacts with minimal token expenditure. Includes a Rust reference implementation of the apply engine plus an evaluation CLI for measuring token efficiency against real LLM runs.

## Features

- **Envelope system** — three operation types (`synthesize`, `edit`, `handle`) for full generation, targeted updates, and lightweight references
- **Stateless apply engine** — pure function, no I/O, ~2μs per edit; portable to browsers (WASM), IDEs, CLIs, or service backends
- **ID-based targeting** — `<gap:target id="ID">` markers and JSON Pointer paths eliminate hallucinated search strings
- **Format-agnostic** — works with HTML, Python, JavaScript, JSON, YAML, Rust, Go, SVG, and more
- **Up to 99% output token reduction** per edit — actual reduction depends on edit scope: ~95-99% for value changes, ~80-95% for section rewrites; total cost savings depend on model pricing ratio and edit history ([cost model](spec/gap.md#711-cost-model))
- **SSE transport binding** — wire format for streaming with reconnection support ([GAP-SSE](spec/gap-sse.md))
- **Evaluation framework** — 90 experiment datasets measuring token efficiency and reliability against real LLM runs

## Install

**Rust crate:**

```sh
cargo add generative-artifact-protocol
```

**From source (full workspace):**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/urmzd/generative-artifact-protocol
cd generative-artifact-protocol
```

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable) and optionally [just](https://github.com/casey/just) (for recipes).

## Quick Start

```sh
# Build the Rust library
just build

# Run tests
just test

# Run criterion benchmarks (apply engine speed)
just bench

# Build the eval CLI (release)
just build-eval

# Run LLM evaluations
just run count=5 model="gemini-2.0-flash"

# Generate report from experiment metrics
just report
```

## Usage

### How it works

```
LLM ──produces──▶ envelope ──apply──▶ (artifact, handle)
                                 ▲
                           gap (stateless, ~2μs)
```

1. An LLM produces an artifact envelope (JSON) — either a `synthesize` envelope (full content with target markers) or an `edit` envelope (targeted changes by ID or JSON Pointer).
2. The apply engine resolves the envelope against the current artifact state to produce the updated artifact and a lightweight handle.
3. The orchestrator holds handles; the resolved artifact is stored and consumed by downstream tools — browsers, IDEs, etc.

### Apply engine

The core of the library is a single stateless function:

```rust
pub fn apply(artifact: Option<&Artifact>, envelope: &Envelope) -> Result<(Artifact, Envelope)>
```

| Envelope | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **synthesize** | input | Complete artifact content (baseline or reset) with `<gap:target>` markers |
| **edit** | input | Targeted changes via ID (`<gap:target>` markers) or JSON Pointer |
| **handle** | output | Lightweight reference returned after every synthesize or edit |

### Recipes

| Recipe | Description |
|---|---|
| `just build` | Compile the Rust library |
| `just test` | Run Rust unit tests |
| `just bench` | Criterion micro-benchmarks (apply engine speed) |
| `just build-eval` | Build the eval CLI (release) |
| `just run [count] [model] [id] [flow] [api-base] [api-key]` | Run conversation benchmark experiments (base vs GAP flows) |
| `just report` | Generate markdown report from experiment metrics |
| `just score` | Retroactive quality scoring of experiment results |

### Cost model

GAP saves tokens by replacing full artifact regeneration with small edit envelopes. The actual savings are **not deterministic** — they depend on edit scope, how efficiently the LLM generates envelopes, the model's tokenizer, and pricing. The LLM may produce larger-than-minimal edits or fall back to full regeneration. The estimates below assume well-formed, targeted edits. See the [full derivation in the spec](spec/gap.md#711-cost-model).

In a naive conversation, each turn's input carries everything: instructions, all prior artifact versions, all prior messages, and the current request — growing quadratically with edit count. GAP's maintain context is **stateless**: each call starts fresh with only the instructions ($I$), the current artifact ($S$), and the edit request. It produces a small edit envelope ($d$ output tokens) and terminates. The apply engine resolves the edit deterministically (CPU, ~2μs, zero tokens). Three effects compound:

- **Input token reduction:** a naive conversation at edit $k$ reads $I + S_0 + S_1 + \ldots + S_{k-1}$ — every prior version. GAP reads only $I + S_{k-1}$ — the current artifact. At 10 edits, this is ~78% fewer input tokens.
- **Output token reduction:** the LLM produces $d$ tokens instead of $S$ per edit — only the changed content plus a constant envelope overhead (JSON structure, target IDs). $d$ scales with the size of the change, not the size of the artifact. A two-value edit on a 2,000-token artifact produces ~30 tokens; a section rewrite produces hundreds. Either way, unchanged content is never regenerated.
- **Model asymmetry:** the maintain context can use a cheaper model than the orchestrator, multiplying savings further.

**Projected example** — using a reference model at \$3/M input, \$15/M output ($r = 5$), with a 2,000-token artifact, 30-token edit envelope, and 500 instruction tokens:

| After $N$ edits | Naive conversation | GAP | Estimated savings |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | \$0.069 | \$0.039 | ~43% |
| 5 | \$0.279 | \$0.071 | ~75% |
| 10 | \$0.677 | \$0.111 | ~84% |

> These figures assume ideal edit behavior ($d = 30$ tokens per edit). Actual savings vary — larger edits, section-level rewrites, or model-specific tokenization will shift these numbers. Savings also scale with $r$: at $r = 1$ (equal pricing), per-edit savings drop to ~44%; at $r = 5$, they reach ~79%.

### Payload benchmarks

Payload size and apply time for each envelope type, measured against an 8 KB HTML dashboard fixture.

> **Note:** "Payload savings" measures **byte reduction** — a proxy for output token reduction but not identical (tokenizers vary). See [cost model](spec/gap.md#711-cost-model) for the full derivation.

| Envelope | Scenario | Payload | % of Full | Payload savings | Apply Time |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **synthesize** | Full generation (baseline) | 8,164 B | 100.0% | — | 1 ns |
| **edit** | 1 value replace (ID targeting) | 12 B | 0.1% | **99.9%** | 1.5 µs |
| **edit** | 4 value replaces (ID targeting) | 50 B | 0.6% | **99.4%** | 3.5 µs |
| **edit** | 1 section replace (ID targeting) | 441 B | 5.4% | **94.6%** | 1.4 µs |
| **edit** | 2 section replaces (ID targeting) | 516 B | 6.3% | **93.7%** | 3.8 µs |
